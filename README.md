# lilypond
Collection of Lilypond files. The sources are free of copyrights. Please let me know if this is not the case.

## building

To typeset the files with Lilypond use for example:

```bash
$ lilypond Thirty_Melodies.ly
```

This will generate a pdf file with part of 'Thirty melodies' by Berthold Tours.

## development

To accurately generate the Lilypond files from the original sheet music, I use the following checklist:

- check title
- check tempo
- check notes and rests
- check bows
- check ties
- check crescendo and decrescendo marks
- check textual crescendo and decrescendo
- check p/pp/mf/etc annotation
- check direction of stems for middle note
